write access means that after you run "git clone", you will be able to run "git push". You will also be able to merge pull request on GitHub.


# min-weight-decoder

write a min weight decoder for Hamming code, both clasical and quantum.

- [7,4,3] classical code
- [[7,1,3]] quantum code



# TODO
create a branch, edit info in the following format, and then send your update to master branch.

## list of branches
- master
  - main branch. For a small project, one edit everything in master branch. For a relatively large project, or a project maintained by multiple people, one usually edit in other branch and only send stable update to master branch.
- weilei
  - created by weilei
- branch name
  - info

## cmd
to do it locally
```
git clone ...
git checkout -b new-branch
(now edit files as you like...)
git status
git add -A
git commit -m "what I have done?"
git checkout master
git merge new-branch
git checkout new-branch
(continue editing and repeat)
```
You may get a conflict error if someone else updated the master branch. To resolve it, it is better to pull all updates to your branch first.
```
git checkout new-branch
git check master
(It will show you if there is a conflict. If yes, find the file and edit it. Then commit the changes)
git checkout master
git check new-branch
```

To edit it locally and send pull request on GitHub
```
git checkout -b new-branch
(edit files and commit)
git push --set-upstream origin new-branch
(Now you have update the new branch to github. Go to github and make a pull request from new-branch to master)
```

## More on coding
It is optional, but if you feel it useful, write a min weight decoder in C/C++ or GAP. You can use existing code as well.
